In the context of the Cyber Physical Systems toward the realization of a Digital Twin system for future manufacturing and product service systems we propose the use of AutomationML to model attributes related to the Digital Twin. Also, we propose that this model is very useful for data exchange between different systems that are connected with the Digital Twin. We present a case study where a industrial component was modeled and simulated to prove that our methodology works.}

keywords = {Assembly, Simulation, Quality assurance},
abstract = {Simulations of products and production processes are extensively used in the engineering phase. To secure good geometrical quality in the final product, tolerances, locator positions, clamping strategies, welding sequence, etc. are optimized during design and pre-production. Faster optimization algorithms, increased computer power and amount of available data, can leverage the area of simulation toward real-time control and optimization of products and production systems – a concept often referred to as a Digital Twin. This paper specifies and highlights functionality and data models necessary for real-time geometry assurance and how this concept allows moving from mass production to more individualized production.}
